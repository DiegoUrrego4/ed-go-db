# Development

1. Rename the file ```.env-template``` to ```.env```
2. Update the environment variables in the .env file to configure the PostgreSQL connection.
3. Run the application:
   - Navigate to the cmd/main directory and run the application with ```go run .```
   - Or, run it directly from this README:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
